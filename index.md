## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab #7
Lab 7 was one of my favorites because it brought a real world occurrence; finding parking when you travel, to coding. Also it was one of my favorite because it required the use of the or (||) operator, which is one of my favorite operators to use in coding. That is why lab 7 is one of my favorite labs that I have worked on.

Lab #6 Part 2
Lab 6 part 2 was another one of my favorite labs because it used blackjack, one of my favorite card games to help us learn coding. Even though it was a bit tricky I loved the way it required to build the whole game in code form. The way we broke down the card game into code is the reason why Lab 6 part 2 was one of my favorites. 

Lab #9 Part 2
Lab 9 part 2 was yet another favorite because it was a guessing game, which I thought was a fun twist to code. Furthermore it was one of my favorites because it required the use of the  >>, ==, <<,  and || operators, which are personally one of my favorite operators to use. The fun I had during the coding was the reason why Lab 9 part 2 is one of my favorites.
